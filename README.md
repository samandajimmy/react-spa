- App bootstrap and routing design
- MV* design (MVC/MVVM/MVW) (im using flux. im not sure if its one of them or no, but i think yes)
- Template rendering (HTML/CSS)

# What's Expected
- Multi-page SPA with 2-3 feature using javascript
- Written against API endpoints with clear UX/UI description.

# Fundamental Library
React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

* **Just the UI:** Lots of people use React as the V in MVC. Since React makes no assumptions about the rest of your technology stack, it's easy to try it out on a small feature in an existing project.
* **Virtual DOM:** React abstracts away the DOM from you, giving a simpler programming model and better performance. React can also render on the server using Node, and it can power native apps using [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/).
* **Data flow:** React implements one-way reactive data flow which reduces boilerplate and is easier to reason about than traditional data binding.

**NEW**! Check out our newest project [React Native](https://github.com/facebook/react-native), which uses React and JavaScript to create native mobile apps.
